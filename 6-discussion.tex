\section{Stacking Potential}
  [TODO: Mention the noise observed in the unfiltered sampling and the simplifications of the model]

  [TODO: Emphasize on the accuracy and practicality of the visualization]

  [TODO: Mention how the model works for amino-amino interactions even if these were discarded when generating it, and the main contributors are actually nucleic-nucleic interactions. ie the stacking potential seems to be generic for aromatic groups, regardless of the different structures that can be found for aromatic groups]

  [TODO: Discuss the observations from the benchmarks]
