[TODO: improve the GUI by adding direct control over the calculation parameters in UnityMol (eg resolution, trimming options)]

[TODO: implement calculations directly within Unity; improve performance]

[TODO: model different stacking types, parallel and perpendicular]

[TODO: implement the "whole" mode]

[TODO: implement fieldlines over shifted normalized version of the grids]

[TODO: addition of new types of grids]

[TODO: implement pharmacophore visualization in UnityMol]

[TODO: implement pipeline involving the ligands (ligand potentials, interactive ligands for trimming)]
